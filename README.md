## Solar Panels in Satellite Imagery: Object Detection
The main aim of this task was data exploration, solar panels detection using object detection, understand metrics for object detection evaluation, and implement them.
The dataset contains all the folders with images, labels (not uploaded here) and dataset.yaml file for YOLO training.

The specific tasks and its notebooks are : 
1. Data Exploration and Understanding - <a href='https://github.com/aryagokh/Satellite_Images_Task/blob/main/notebooks/Data_Exploration.ipynb'>Notebook 1</a>
2. Understanding and implementation of Fundamental functions like VOC 11, COCO 101 (interpolations), IoU etc - <a href='https://github.com/aryagokh/Satellite_Images_Task/blob/main/notebooks/Fundamental_Functions.ipynb'>Notebook 2</a>
3. Train test splits of the data - <a href='https://github.com/aryagokh/Satellite_Images_Task/blob/main/notebooks/train_test_split.py'>Splits.py</a>
4. Building and Evaluation of the model (eval using both implementation and supervision.metrics) - <a href='https://github.com/aryagokh/Satellite_Images_Task/blob/main/notebooks/yolov8_BuildnEval.ipynb'>Notebook 3</a>
